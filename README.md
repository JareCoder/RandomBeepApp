# Random Beep App

The app was developed to test a proof of concept idea for coaching.  
It needed to be easy to use, simple to configure settings, and be easily distributed to a handful of test users.  
Feedback is used to refine coaching methods.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** On first launch, the app will generate a `settings.json` file with default values.
